# Pragmatic Software Development Tips

###Care About Your Craft
Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

###Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done; explain what can be done.

###Be a Catalyst for Change
You can’t force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.

###Make Quality a Requirements Issue
Involve your users in determining the project’s real quality requirements.

###Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
Don’t be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.

###DRY—Don’t Repeat Yourself
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
