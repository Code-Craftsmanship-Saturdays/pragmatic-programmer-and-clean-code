##DRY—Don’t Repeat Yourself
###Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

****How does Duplication Arise?****

###Imposed Duplication.
*Developers feel they have no choice - the environment seems to require duplication*

###Inadvertent duplication.
*Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information.*

###Impatient duplication.
*Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easy.*

###Interdeveloper duplication.
*Multiple people on a team duplicate a piece of information.*

###Exercise instructions
*1. Open program.js*
*2. Study the ugly average implementation and think why it is not dry.*
*3. Add another average function.*
*4. Add additional test in program.test.js with your refactored implementation.*
