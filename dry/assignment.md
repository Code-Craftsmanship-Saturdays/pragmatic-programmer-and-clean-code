## DRY—Don’t Repeat Yourself

### Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

****How does Duplication Arise?****

### Imposed Duplication.

*Developers feel they have no choice - the environment seems to require duplication*

### Inadvertent duplication.

*Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information.*

### Impatient duplication.

*Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easy.*

### Interdeveloper duplication.

*Multiple people on a team duplicate a piece of information.*

### Exercise instructions

*1. Open program.js*

*2. Study the ugly average implementation and think why it is not dry.*

*3. Fix failing tests by correcting implementation and read TODOS in each tests.*

###### The testing framework ava.js only reports the failing assertion but not all of them like tape.js and mocha.js so be mindful of this.
