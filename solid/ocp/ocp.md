## Open/Closed Principle

[Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)

In object-oriented programming, the open/closed principle states:
- "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
- that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
- The name open/closed principle has been used in two ways.
- Both ways use inheritance to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.
