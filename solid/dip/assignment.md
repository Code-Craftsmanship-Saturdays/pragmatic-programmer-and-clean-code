## Dependency inversion principle 

**[Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)**

In object-oriented design, the dependency inversion principle refers to a specific form of decoupling software modules. When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. 

The principle states:

**1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**
**2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.**
